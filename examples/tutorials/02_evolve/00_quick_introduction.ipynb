    "The set of notebooks in this folder introduce you to the basic functionalities of `expsolve` for solving PDEs using Fourier spatial discretization. We will import\n",

    "* `expsolve` as `es`\n",

    "* `expsolve.discretize.tensorgrid` as `ex` (Fourier and finite difference spatial discretizations on equispaced tensorized grids)\n",

    "The convention across all notebooks is to use `ex` for the spatial discretization (unless more than one spatial discretization is being considered). Doing so allows us to quickly change spatial discretisation. The examples considered in this folder are\n",
